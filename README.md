## I. PROJECT GOALS
*"The goal of this project is to apply suitable machine learning algorithms learned in class or self-learned
to solve a specific data science problem (classification, regression, clustering). Represent the results in
graphical/table formats and make analysis and conclusions."* 

## II. DATA INFORMATIONS

### i. CHOSEN DATA REPOSITORY
Data repository used:
- Kaggle Data Repository : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

### ii. CHOSEN DATASET
Dataset used:
- The BeeImage Dataset: Annotated Honey Bee Images : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jenny18/honey-bee-annotated-images

## III. PROJECT SUMMARY
*This dataset aims to provide basic visual data to train machine learning models to classify bees in these categories, paving the way for more intelligent hive monitoring or beekeeping in general.*
With this dataset we aim to solve a data science problem (Classification) - predict the subspecies of a bee based on a image using machine learning alghoritms (in this case, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks).
